This is a model of the classic game Connect Four.
The user plays using their mouse, their opponent is the computer.
I have programmed the computer to make intelligent moves, only relying on random movesif
there are no more useful moves available.
As does a human, the computer searches for a winning move first, then searches for any
possible winning human moves in the future, so it may block them.
From there, it looks for the next best moves, ensuring his moves will not result in a 
win by the human unless there is essentially a checkmate, and the human winning is imminent

To run this GUI, run view>GameFrame.java as a Java Application.
